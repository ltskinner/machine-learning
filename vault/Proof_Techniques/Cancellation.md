Pattern:
- Create duplication
- Cancel them out

## Template

- 1. rewrite something using an [[Identity Element]]
- 2. Use distributivity to expand
- 3. Cancel using [[Inverse Element]]

## Examples

### 1.30 Number 0 times a vector

Definition: $0v = 0$ for every $v \in V$

Proof:
For $v \in V$, we have
$0v = (0 + 0)v$ (really, $0v = (0)v$, then introduce `additive identity` $(0) = (0 + 0)$)
$0v = 0v + 0v$
Then, we add the additive inverse of $0v$ to each side, which is really like $+(-0v)$, which gives
$0 = 0v$, as desired

### 1.31 Number a times the vector 0

Definition: $a0 = 0$ for every $a \in F$

Proof:
Suppose $a \in F$, we have
$a0 = a(0 + 0)$ (again, really is $a(0)$, and introduce identity so $(0) = (0 + 0)$)
$a0 = a0 + a0$, then additive inverses, so $0 = a0$, as desired
