## Definition

Multiplication is a [[Binary Operation]] that combines two elements into their `product`

$\alpha\beta$

## Intuition

Multiplication **scales** or **repeatedly combines** magnitude

## Key Insight

Multiplication defines the multiplicative structure of a system

## Why it Matters

- Enables scaling and ratios
- Supports division via [[Multiplicative Inverse]]
- Defines a [[Field]] and scalar multiplication
- Encodes [[Rotation]] and [[Scaling]] in $\mathbb{C}$

## Structural Links

- Has an [[Identity Element]] (1)
- Supports a [[Multiplicative Inverse]]
- Interacts with addition via [[Distributive Property]]
