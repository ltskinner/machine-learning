## Definition

A set S is `closed under an operation` $\oplus$ if:

$\alpha, \beta \in S \implies \alpha \oplus \beta \in S$

That is, combining elements of a set S can only produce elements inside the same set S

## Intuition

You never leave the world you started in - the system is self contained

## Key Insight

- Closure is what makes an operation "well defined" on a set
- Without closure, algebraic structure breaks

## Examples

- $\mathbb{R}$ is closed under [[Addition]] and [[Multiplication]]
- Integers $\mathbb{Z}$ are **not** closed under division
- Matrices of fixed size are closed under [[Matrix Multiplication]]

## Why it Matters

Closure is required to define:

- [[Binary Operation]]
- [[Group]]
- [[Ring]]
- [[Field]]
- [[Vector Space]]

Without closure, structure cannot exist
