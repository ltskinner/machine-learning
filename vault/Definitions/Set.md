## Definition

A `set` is a collection of distinct mathematical `objects`, called `elements`

## Intuition

A set defines the universe of allowed objects (the world we're operating in)

## Examples

- $\mathbb{R}$
- $\mathbb{C}$
- The set of all vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$

## Why it Matters

[[Operation]], [[Property]], and [[Structure]] are always defined on a set

## Key Insight

No structure can exist without an underlying sets
