An `abelian group` is a set G with a binary operation (+) such that (the operation has):

- Closure
- Commutativity
- Associativity
- Identity elements (exist)
- Every element has an inverse

## Intuition

An abelian group models a system where elements can be combined, reordered, and undone without ambiguity

### Examples

- ($\mathbb{Z}$, +) (addition operator)
- ($\mathbb{R}$, +) (addition operator)
- ($\mathbb{C}$, +) (addition operator)

### Why it Matters

Abelian groups formalize `additive structure`, which underlies:

- Vector addition
- Linear combinations
- Kernel and image structure
### Contrast

Non-abelian groups allow order-dependent composition (e.g., rotations in 3D)
