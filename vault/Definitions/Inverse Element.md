## Definition

Let $S$ be a `set` with:
- a `binary operation`  $\oplus$ 
- `identity element` $e$

An element $\beta$ is an `inverse` of $\alpha$ if:

$\alpha \oplus \beta = e$

An inverse is an element that **undoes** the effects of another element

## Examples

- [[Additive Inverse]]
- [[Multiplicative Inverse]]

## Key Insight

Inverses are defined **relative to** an `operation` and its `identity`

aka: different operations have different inverses
