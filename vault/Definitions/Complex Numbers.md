Complex Numbers $\mathbb{C}$

$\mathbb{C} = \{a + bi | a, b \in \mathbb{R} \}$
$i^2 = -1$
Numbers with both real and imaginary components

## Intuition

$\mathbb{C}$ extends $\mathbb{R}$ so that every polynomial has roots

Geometrically: a 2D plane where multiplication encodes [[rotation]] and [[scaling]]

### Core Properties

- Closed under addition, multiplication, and division (except by zero)
- No natural total ordering
- Forms a [[field]]
- $\mathbb{R}$ is a subfield of $\mathbb{C}$

### Why it Matters

$\mathbb{C}$ is essential for:
- Eigenvalues of real matrices
- Spectral theory
- Fourier analysis
- Quantum mechanics
- Complex vector spaces $\mathbb{C}^n$

### Key Insight

Complex multiplication = rotation + scaling
