## Definition

Suppose $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$

For $\alpha = 0$, let $1/\alpha$ and $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ denote the `multiplicative inverse` of $\alpha$. Thus $1/\alpha$ is the unique complex number such that

$\alpha(1/\alpha) = 1$

For $\alpha \neq 0$, `division` by $\alpha$ is defined by

$\beta/\alpha = \beta(1/\alpha)$

## Intuition

Division means multiplying by the multiplicative undoing of a quantity

## Key Insight

Division is **not** a `primitive operation` - it is multiplication applied to a multiplicative inverse

## Why it Matters

- Reduces division to `multiplication`
- Defines fields
- Enables ratios, scaling, and normalization

## Failure Case

Division by zero is undefined because 0 has no `multiplicative inverse`
