## Definition

Multiplication distributes over addition if:

$\lambda(\alpha + \beta) = \lambda \alpha + \lambda \beta$

## Intuition

Scaling a sum equals summing scaled terms

### Why it Matters

Connects additive and multiplicative structure. Essential for:

- Expanding expressions
- Linearity
- Vector space axioms
