## Definition

Addition is a [[Binary Operation]] that combines two elements into their `sum`

$\alpha + \beta$

## Intuition

Addition accumulates or combines magnitude

## Key Insight

Addition defines the additive structure of a system

## Why it Matters

- Forms [[Abelian Group]]
- Defines vector addition
- Underlies linear combinations and kernels

## Structural Links

- Has an [[Identity Element]] (0)
- Supports an [[Additive Inverse]]
- Satisfies [[Associativity]] and [[Commutativity]]
