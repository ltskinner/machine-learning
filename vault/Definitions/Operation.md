## Definition

An operation is a `rule` for combining one of more elements of a set, to produce another element

[[Binary Operation]] are an example of this

## Intuition

An operation defines how elements **interact**

## Examples

- [[Addition]] on $\mathbb{R}$
- [[Multiplication]] on $\mathbb{C}$
- [[Matrix Multiplication]]

## Why it Matters

Operations turn a `set` into something **algebraically meaningful**
