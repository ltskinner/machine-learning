An operation $\oplus$ is `commutative` if:

- $\alpha \oplus \beta = \beta \oplus \alpha$ for all $\alpha, \beta$ in the set

## Examples

- $\alpha + \beta = \beta + \alpha$
- $\alpha\beta = \beta\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$

### Intuition

Order does not matter

### Why it Matters

Allows:
- Reordering sums and products
- Simplifying expressions
- Clean algebraic manipulation

### Failure Cases

Matrix multiplication is NOT commutative
