A number system is `complete` if every [[Cauchy Sequence]] converges to a number within the system at limit

## Intuition

You can't ever leave the number system

## Contrast with Closure

- [[Closed]]: the results of operations stay inside the set (algebraic)
- Complete: the limits of sequences stay inside the set (analytic as opposed to algebraic)
