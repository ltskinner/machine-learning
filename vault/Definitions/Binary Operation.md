## Definition

A `binary operation` on a set S is a function:

$\oplus : S \times S \rightarrow S$

that takes two elements of S and returns another element of S

## Intuition

A rule for combining two elements into one element, sourced from the same set

## Why it Matters

Binary operations define `algebraic structure`, including:

- [[Group]]
- [[Ring]]
- [[Field]]
- [[Vector Space]]

All algebra begins with a set + a `binary operation`

## Examples

- Addition on $\mathbb{R}$
- Multiplication on $\mathbb{C}$
- [[Matrix Multiplication]]
