## Definition

A `property` (aka `law`) is a rule that describes how an [[Operation]] behaves

An `axiom` is a `property` that is assumed as a defining requirement

## Examples

- [[Associativity]]
- [[Commutativity]]
- [[Closure]]
- Existence of Identity
- Existence of Inverses

## Intuition

A property constrains what an `operation` is allowed to do

## Why it Matters

`Properties` determine what kind of [[Structure]] a system has

A structure is defined by: which properties its operations satisfy
