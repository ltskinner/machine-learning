## Definition

A `function` is a mapping:

$f: A \rightarrow B$

that assigns **exactly** one output in $B$ to each input in $A$, producing `elements`

## Function

A rule that transforms inputs into outputs

## Why it Matters

[[Operation]]s are special cases of `functions`

- Every operation is a function
- But, not every function is an operation
