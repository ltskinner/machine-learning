## Definition

A `function` is a mapping from [[set]] $X$ to [[set]] $Y$:

$f: X \rightarrow Y$

Assigns each `element` of $X$ to exactly one `element` of $Y$

Think:

$f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$

- The `domain` of the function (from $X$) is R
- The `codomain` of the function (to $Y$) is R

if $f(x) = x^2$

The `range` = `image` = $[0, \infty)$

## Function

A rule that transforms inputs into outputs

## Why it Matters

[[Operation]]s are special cases of `functions`

- Every operation is a function
- But, not every function is an operation
