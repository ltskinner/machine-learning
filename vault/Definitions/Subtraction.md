## Definition

Suppose $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$

Let $-\alpha$ denote the `additive inverse` of $\alpha$. Thus $-\alpha$ is the unique `complex number` such that

$\alpha + (-\alpha) = 0$

`subtraction` on $\mathbb{C}$ is defined by:

$\beta - \alpha = \beta + (-\alpha)$

## Intuition

Subtraction means adding the **cancelling partner** of a quantity

## Key Insights

Subtraction is **not** a `primitive operation` - it is addition applied to an `additive inverse`

## Why it matters

- Reduces subtraction to **addition**
- Enables equation solving
- Preserves group structure
