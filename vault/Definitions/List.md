## Definition

- Suppose $n$ is a nonnegative integer
- A `list` of `length` $n$ is:
	- An ordered collection of $n$ elements
	- These elements can be numbers, other lists, or more abstract objects
- Two `lists` are equal IFF they have:
	- The same length
	- Same elements in the same order

## Examples

A list of length n may be written as:

$(z_1, ..., z_n)$

An empty list is also considered to avoid trivial exceptions to theorems

$()$

## Differentiators

What differentiates a [[Set]] from a `List`

- In lists, order matters and repetitions have meaning
- In sets, order and repetitions are irrelevant
