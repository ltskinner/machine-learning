## Definition

A `structure` is a set equipped with one or more `operations` that satisfy specified `properties`

## Examples

- [[Group]] = set + 1 operation + group properties:
	- Closure [[Closed]]
	- [[Associativity]]
	- Identity [[Identity Element]]
	- Inverses
	- -> If that operation is commutative, then an Abelian Group
- [[Ring]] = set + 2 operations + ring properties
- [[Field]] = set + 2 operations + stronger properties
	- [[Addition]] + [[Multiplication]]
- [[Vector Space]] = set + scalar field + operations
