`field` - a set equipped with addition and multiplication such that:
- Addition forms an [[abelian group]]
- Multiplication forms an [[abelian group]] over nonzero elements
- Multiplication distributes over addition

## Intuition

A field is a number system where you can:

- Add and subtract
- Multiply and divide (except by zero)

### Examples

- $\mathbb{Q}$ Rationals
- $\mathbb{R}$ [[Real Numbers]]
- $\mathbb{C}$ [[Complex numbers]]

### Why it Matters

Fields define what scalars are. Vector spaces, eigenvalues, and linear transformations all depend on the underlying field

### Failure Cases

$\mathbb{Z}$ (integers) are not a field (no multiplicative inverse for most elements)
