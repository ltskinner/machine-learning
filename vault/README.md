# Knowledge Vault

This vault exists to train **availability**, not catalogue every niche detail ever

## Note Patterns

- Definition
- Examples
- Intuition
- Properties
- Why it Matters
- Contrast / Failure Cases
- Links
### Flashcard Patterns (for each Note)

- Definition Recall (recall the formal idea)
- Property Recognition (recognize when applies)
- Meaning / Intuition (significance of it existing)
- Contrast / Failure Modes (distinguish from nearby concepts)
- Application Bridge (how connects to LA / Graphs)


## Core philosophy

- This vault stores **concepts**, not chapters
- Notes exist to **support thinking**, not to preserve text
- Anything worth keeping here should be usable without reopening the book

## Content goals

- Definitions that need to be readily recallable
- Structural facts and invariants
- Recognizing what to use and when
- Canonical examples
- Confusions that led to insight

## Things that DON'T belong

- Chapter summaries
- Long derivations copied from books
- Exhaustive coverage of material
- Passive notes taken to avoid forgetting

## Atomicity

Each note should contain **one** idea that does not require scrolling

If the note cannot be summarized in one sentence or generate a good flashcard, then it should be spit or discarded

- Prefer my own words over formal phrasing
- Write for future recall, not completeness at present
- Use links liberally
- **Don't write just to check the box**
