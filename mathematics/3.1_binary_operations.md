# Binary Operations

A Binary operation on a set S is a function f: SxS -> S

- a special type of funciton
- SxS is the cartesian product
  - SxS means elements from the same set
    - could be the same
    - could be different
  - and maps them to exactly one element, which is also in that set

Example:

- g: RxR -> R (Real numbers cross Real) -(maps to)> Real numbers
- g(a, b) = a + b
- g(3, 5) = 8
- this is addition function

Sameas:

"a composed with b"

- a*b
- axb
- ab
- a.b (as in g after f)

## Example of NOT a binary operation

- task: multiplication on {2, 3, 4}
  - {2, 3, 4} is NOT closed under normal multiplication
- domain of binary operation is the cartesian product:
  - {2, 3, 4}x{2, 3, 4}
  - the domain elements are ordered pairs
  - example element from domain:
    - (3, 4)
    - note: 3x4 = 12, which is not an element of the set {2, 3, 4}

## Hammer Home

binary operation takes two elements from the same set

and returns an element from the same set
