# Information Geometry and Its Applications

## Preface

- Information geometry is a method of exploring the world of information by means of modern geometry
- Theories of information have so far been studied mostly by using:
  - Agebraic
  - Logical
  - Analytical
  - Probabilistic methods
- Since geometry studies mutual relations between elements such as distance and curvature, it should provide the information sciences with powerful tools
