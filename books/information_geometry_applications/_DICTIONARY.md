- `topological space`
  - a geometrical space in which closeness is defined but cannot necessarily be measured by a numeric distance
  - is a set whose elements are called `points`
    - along with an additional structure called a topology
      - which can be defined as a set of `neighbourhoods` for each point that satisfy some axioms formalizing the concept of closeness
  - Common types of topological spaces:
    - Euclidian spaces
    - metric spaces
    - manifolds
- `metric space`
  - a set together with anotion of distance between its elements (the elements are usually called points)
  - the distance is measured by a function called a `metric` or a `distance function`
  - metric spaces are the most general setting for studying many of the concepts of mathematical analysis and geometry
- `point`
  - An abstract idealization of an exact position, without size, in a physical space, or its generalization to other kinds of mathematical spaces
  - are zero-dimensional objects
  - these are fundamental invisible elements comprising the space
    - of which 1d curves, 2d surfaces, and higher dimensional objects consist
    - conversely, a point van be determined by the intersection of two curves or three surfaces, called a vertex or corner
- `divergence`
  - represents a degree of separation of two points
  - but, it is not a distance since it is not symmetric with repsect to the two points
- `line`
  - an infinitely long object wiht no width, depth, or curvature (ray of light)
- `curve`
  - an object similar to a line ,but that does not have to be straight
  - A curve is the image of an interval to a topological space by a continuous function
- `image`
  - for a function f: X -> Y
    - the image is the output value produced by f when passed x (an input value of type X)
    - image of an element
  - a set, called the "image of A under (or though) f"
    - is produced by evaluating f at each element of a given subset A of its domain X
    - image of a subset
  - The image of the funcion f is the set of all output values it may produce, that is, the image of X
    - image of a function
- `interval`
  - the set of all numbers lying between two fixed endpoints with no gaps
  - real numbers, including positive and negative infinity
  - [0,1] - inclusive (of endpoints)
    - `closed interval` - if *both* are square
  - (0, inf) - exclusive
    - `open interval` - if *both* are parentheses
      - does not include any endpoints
- `continuous function`
  - a function such that a small variation of the argument induces a small variation of the value of the function
  - implies no abrupt changes in value, known as discontinuities
  - a function is continuous if arbitrarily small changes in its value can be assured by restructing to sufficiently small changes of its argument
- `neighbourhood`
  - a neighbourhood of a point is a set of points containing that point where one can move some amount in any direction away from that point without leaving the set
- `open set`
  - a generalization of an open interval on the real line
  - a set that, along with every point P, contains all points that are sufficiently near to P
    - "sufficiently near" means points whose distance to P is less than < some value, depending on P
    - like, the set depends on the distances and the value threshold, not a fixed set
- `closed set`
  - a set which contains all its `limit points`
  - do NOT confuse with a closed manifold
- `bounded set`
  - a set is called bounded if all of its points are within a certain distance of each other
  - the word "bounded" makes no sense in a general topological space without a corresponding metric
- `limit points` aka `accumulation point` aka `cluster point`
  - a cluster point of a set S in a topological space XL is:
  - a point x that can be "approximated" by points of S in the sense that every neighbourhood of x contains a point of S other than x itself
  - A limit point of set S does not itself have to be an element of S
- `interior`
  - the interior of a subset S of a topological space X is the union of all subsets of S that ar open in X
  - A point that is in the interior of S is an interior point of S
  The interior of S is the complement of the closure of the complement of s. In this sense interior and closure are `dual` notions
- `exterior`
  - the exterior of a set S is the complement of the closure of S
  - it consists of the points that are in neither the set nor its boundary
- `boundary`
  - The boudnary of a subset S of a topological space X is the set of points *in the `closure`* of S not belonging to the interior of S
  - the interior, boundary, and exterior of a subset together partition the whole space into three blocks
- `manifold`
  - a topological space that locally resembles `Euclidian space` near each point
  - An n-dimensional manifold is a `topological space` with the property that each point has a `neighborhood` that is `homeomorphic` to an `open subset` of n-dimensional Euclidian space
- `Euclidian space`
  - Topological spacce is a huge generalization of a Euclidian space
  - The original intent of the Euclidian space was like the real world around us in 3 dimensions
- `homeomorphism`
  - a `bijective` and `continuous function` between topological spaces that ahs a continuous inverse function
  - also called *topological isomorphism* or *bicontinuous function*
  - homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces
    - they are mappings that pereserve all the topological properties of a given space
- `bijection` aka `bijective function` aka `one-to-one correspondence`
  - a function between two sets such taht each element of the second set (the codomain) is mapped to from exactly one element of the first set (the domain)
  - equivalently, a bijection is a relation between two sets such that each element of either set is paired with exactly one element of the other set
- convex function
- concave function
- bregman divergence
- affine structure
- Legendre transformation
- Riemannian metric
- generalized Pythagorean theorem
- dual (conjugate) connection
- non-flat dual affine connection
- `compact(ness)`
  - a property that seeks to generalize the notion of a: closed and bounded subset of Euclidian space
