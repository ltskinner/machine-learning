# 📝 Pen-and-Paper Problem Solving Checklist

- 1. Parse + Prime
- 2. Recall + Connect not listed information
- 3. Plan Attack
- 4. Execute with Clarity
- 5. Review and Reflect

## ✅ 1. Parse + Prime (1–2 min)

- [ ] **Underline or box** key values, definitions, constraints, and question prompt.
  > _Highlight what you’re given vs. what’s asked. Look for limiting words: “always,” “exactly,” “prove.”_
  
- [ ] **Rephrase the problem** in your own words.
  > _What is this really asking me to do? Translate into your internal mental model._

- [ ] **Identify problem type or family** (e.g. linear algebra proof, convexity check, PAC-learning bound).
  > _If you had to teach this problem, what would the lesson title be?_

## ✅ 2. Recall + Connect (1–2 min)

- [ ] **List relevant theorems, identities, or concepts** that might apply.
  > _Write these down as scaffolding before jumping in. Think about definitions or properties._

- [ ] **Sketch a small diagram or matrix** if applicable.
  > _Linear map? Draw how spaces transform. Graphical model? Sketch the nodes._

- [ ] **Tag the problem** with the relevant lecture/topic/unit in your prep.
  > _This helps you recall related practice problems._

## ✅ 3. Plan Attack (2–3 min)

- [ ] **Write a 1–3 line outline of the approach.**
  > _Is this proof-by-contradiction? Direct application of definition?_

- [ ] **Label any “critical tools”** (e.g., chain rule, spectral theorem, Hoeffding inequality).
  > _Even if you don’t know all steps, you know your starting weapon._

- [ ] **Identify potential pitfalls or “high-risk” areas.**
  > _Hard integrals, degenerate eigenvalues, etc._

## ✅ 4. Execute with Clarity (5–15 min)

- [ ] **Label each logical step** clearly — avoid skipping rationale.
  > _You’re not just solving for the answer, you’re writing your grader a narrative._

- [ ] **Box intermediate results** or important sub-results.
  > _Helps if you need to re-use later or backtrack._

- [ ] **Keep momentum** — if stuck, write what you *would* do next if you had more info.
  > _You get partial credit and keep your brain moving forward._

## ✅ 5. Review + Reflect (1–3 min)

- [ ] **Double-check units, bounds, signs, and assumptions.**
  > _E.g., are probabilities between 0 and 1? Is your gradient in the correct direction?_

- [ ] **Re-read the prompt** and confirm you answered *exactly* what was asked.
  > _Don't stop at the first boxed equation — check if you justified it fully._

- [ ] **Ask: Does this answer make sense intuitively?**
  > _Could you sanity-check the result by plugging in values or comparing to edge cases?_

## 🧠 Post-Mortem (Optional After Test or Practice)

- [ ] What slowed me down?
- [ ] What step was weakest or most error-prone?
- [ ] What did I guess vs. what did I derive?
- [ ] What "pattern" could I add to my mental index cards?
