# Dictionary

- `category`
  - consists of `objects` and `arrows` that go between them
  - the essence of a category is `composition`
  - or, the essence of `composition` is a category
  - formal def: consists of 3 mathematical entities
    - objects
    - morphisms (maps, arrows)
    - composition (associativity, identity)
- object
- arrow
  - also called `morphisms`
  - are like `functions`
- `identity`
  - an `equality` relating one mathematical `expression` A to another mathematical expression B, such that A and B (which may contain some variables) produce the same value for all values of the variables within a certain range of validity
  - A = B is an identity if A and B define the same functions, and an identity is an equality between functions that are differently defined
  - identities are the tripple bar, like an equal sign but with 3
- equality
- expression
- variables
- universal quantification
- `identity morphisms`
- monoid
- associativity
  - (a+b)+c = a+(b+c)
  - aka - we can skip the parentheses when adding numbers

### Orders

- homset
  - A set of morphism from object a to object b in category C is called a *hom-set* written as C(a, b) or, Hom_C(a, b)
  - every homset in a preorder is either empty or a singleton
- preorder
  - a <= b and b <= c, so a <= c
  - "thin" category
  - you may have cycles in a preorder
- partial order
  - a <= b, and b <= a, so a == b
  - cycles are forbidden in a partial order
- linear order aka total order
  - condition that any two objects are in a relation with each other, one way or another

## Graphs

- directed graph

## CS

- polymorphic function
  - a function that can evaluate to or be applied to values of different types
