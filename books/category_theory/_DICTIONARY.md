  - formal def: consists of 3 mathematical entities
    - objects
    - morphisms (maps, arrows)
    - composition (associativity, identity)
- object
- arrow
  - also called `morphisms`
  - are like `functions`
- `identity`
  - an `equality` relating one mathematical `expression` A to another mathematical expression B, such that A and B (which may contain some variables) produce the same value for all values of the variables within a certain range of validity
  - A = B is an identity if A and B define the same functions, and an identity is an equality between functions that are differently defined
  - identities are the tripple bar, like an equal sign but with 3
- equality
- expression
- variables
- universal quantification
- `identity morphisms`
