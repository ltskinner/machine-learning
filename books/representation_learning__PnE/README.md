## [Chapter 1: Introduction to Representation Learning](./CHAPTER_1.md)

- `propositionalization`
  - basically creating columns of binary features
- `embedding`
  - see "PropStar algorithm"
  - think like PCA for dense numeric embeddings
    - (not literally PCA, necessarily, just the output)
- Assessing quality of learned representations
  - intrinsic eval:
    - similaries in input space are preserved in final transformed representations
      - loss function, reconstruction error
