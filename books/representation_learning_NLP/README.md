Essential features of a **good** word representation:

- Informative Word Representation
- Interpretable Word Representation

- contrastive learning
  - DSGC
    - instead of contrasting augmented data, conduct views from dual spaces of **hyperbolic and Euclidian**
    - same node, differnt space - that is super interesting

- **shortcut arcs**
- like the learned representations are effectively the subconscious?
  - reasoning is the conscious?
- tasks of
  - scene graph generation -> what application areas are under discussed?
  - document level relation extraction
  - "both tasks are worthy of exploration for future research"
- tokenizers
  - is there a unified text+image tokenizer?
    - image tokenization is neat
    - and I think general tokenization was solved "quickly"
