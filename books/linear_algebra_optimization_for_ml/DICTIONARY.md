# Dictionary: Linear Algebra and Optimization

- nxn vector
  - (column x rows)
  - abCdef....qRst.... columns come before rows
- `row vector`
  - 1xd
  - 1x2 = (12, 3)
  - 1x3 = (3, 0, 7)
- `column vector`
  - vectors are assumed to be column vectors, unless specified otherwise
  - nx1
  - 2x1:
    - 23
    - 7
  - 3x1:
    - 7
    - 8
    - 1
- `scalars`
  - individual numerical values typically drawn from the real domain in most ML applications
- `vectors`
  - arrays of numerical values (i.e. arrays of scalars)
  - each numerical value is referred to as a `coordinate`
  - The individual numerical values of the arrays are referred to as `entries`, `components`, or `dimensions`
  - the number of `components` is referred to as the vector `dimensionality`
- `matrices`
  - rectagular arrays of numerical values containing both rows and column
  - to access a value, must specify its row index and column index
  - d properties of n individuals
    - size is n x d
  - n rows of individuals
    - containing d properties
  - the value of the (i,j)th entry of the matrix is:
    - jth property of the ith individual
  - $A = [a_{ij}]_{n \times d}$
  - `square matrix`
    - when rows = columns
  - `rectangular matrix`
    - a non-square matrix
    - tall when more rows than columns
    - wide when more columns than rows
- `commutative`
  - the order of numbers does not matter
  - A + B = B + A
- `Euclidian norm` aka `squared norm`
  - The norm defines the vector length and is denoted by $\|.\|$
  - converts to a unit vector
- `Manhattan norm` or `L_{1}-norm`
  - this is basically just taking the sum of the absolute values
- `attributes` aka `variables`
  - correspond to dimensions in vector space
- `vector space`
  - ex. the infinite set of all possible cartesian coordinates in two dimensions in relation to the origin
- `Linear algebra`
  - can be viewed as a generalized form of the geometry of cartesian coordinates in d dimensions
- `orthogonal`
  - A pair of vectors is `orthogonal` if their dot product is 0 (and the angle between them is 90).
  - The vector \bar{0} is considered orthogonal to every vector.
- `orthonormal`
  - A set of vectors is `orthonormal` if each pair in the set is mutually orthogonal and the norm of each vector is 1.
- `coordinate transformation` or `projection`
  - compute a new set of coordinates with respect to a changed set of directions
