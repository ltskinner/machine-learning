## 🧭 1. Skeleton Building (Before Reading)

Monday

**⏱ Time:** ~5–10 min

- 🔍 Skimmed:
  - [ ] Section headers
  - [ ] Figures
  - [ ] Bold terms
  - [ ] Exercises

**Guiding Questions:**

- What is this chapter trying to help me:
  - ✅ Do:
    - build vocabulary for logic required to support proving things
    - contstruct truth tables from basic operations
    - extend tables to include premises, conclusions
  - ✅ Prove: how first order logic is used to show true and false
  - ✅ Understand:
    - Deductive reasoning and logical connectives (like primative first order logic)
      - set up premises, valid arguments, conclusions
      - tautologies, contradictions
      - true and false values
      - truth tables
    - usefulness of abstracting statements into true/false premises for simplicity of constructing valid argument patterns
    - words matter: or, and, not, etc
      - these are `connective symbols`
      - "but" can be used to mean "and"
    - variable types: bound, free
    - sets and their usefulness
    - operations on sets
      - venn diagrams
      - subset, disjoint
    - conditional and biconditional connectives
      - conditional statements for if -> then

**Prediction:**

> "This chapter probably teaches basic elements and vocabulary so I can build into doing more complex stuff later."

**What Should I be able to Answer by the End of this Chapter**

- Core conceptual questions
- Technical mastery questions
- Proof/intuition checkpoints
- Connection-to-practice questions

## 📘 2. Active Reading

Tuesday

**⏱ Time:** ~20–40 min

| Key Point | Why It Matters | Proof Sketch |
| - | - | - |
| Its ok to use indentation of patterns while learning this |  |  |
| Proof statements are like control statements in programming | Colored purple and usually have open and close terms (statements) |  |
| The existence of one `counterexample` | Establishes a `conjecture` is incorrect, however, the lack of `counterexample` does not prove something to be correct |  |

## 🧠 3. Compression and Encoding

Wednesday

**⏱ Time:** ~30–60 min

### 🔑 Key Definitions

- **conjecture:** a guess
- **theorem:** a conjecture that has been proven
- **factorial:** n! = 1*2*3*...n
- **tautology:** ...
- **contradiction:** ...
- **statement:** ...
- **variable:** ... (bound and free)
- **set:** ...
- **conditional statement:** antecedent and consequent
- **Definition:** ...
- **Definition:** ...

### 📏 Main Theorem Statements

- **[Theorem Name]:** [Plain language description]

### 💡 Core Takeaways

- there is a set of "control statements" like in software, with entry and exit conditions that are used to construct proofs
- defining variable type with {x| something} is like type declarations in software
