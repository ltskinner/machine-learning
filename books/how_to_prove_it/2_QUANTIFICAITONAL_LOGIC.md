## 🧭 1. Skeleton Building (Before Reading)

Monday

**⏱ Time:** ~5–10 min

- 🔍 Skimmed:
  - [ ] Section headers
    - 2.1 Quantifiers
    - 2.2 Equivalences Involving Quantifiers
    - 2.3 More Operations on Sets
  - [ ] Figures
  - [ ] Bold terms
  - [ ] Exercises

**Guiding Questions:**

- What is this chapter trying to help me:
  - ✅ Do:
    - Know and use Quantifiers:
      - "forall" and "there exists"
      - there is some subtleties in the syntax converting between english and logical
  - ✅ Prove: ...
  - ✅ Understand:
    - how to use quantifiers
    - how to better convert english into logical statements aided by quantifiers
    - how to use set theory to construct arguments

**Prediction:**

> "This chapter probably teaches quantifiers so I can express the existence (or lacktherof) of logical claims used to build proofs."

Proofs are basically just showing something exists, or doesnt exist, and chaining a series of those together to build a logical argument in support for the thing you are proving.

**What Should I be able to Answer by the End of this Chapter**

- Core conceptual questions
- Technical mastery questions
  - converting free english statements into quantifier-based logical statements
- Proof/intuition checkpoints
- Connection-to-practice questions

Dang this is like, totally reasonable. These are not rigorous, rushed, sessions trying to cover as much material as quickly as possible, exerting maximum brainpower. Be here to absorb.
