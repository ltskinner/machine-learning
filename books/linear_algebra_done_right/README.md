# Linear Algebra Done Right

- This is a book about serious mathematics, with an emphasis on attaining a deep understanding of:
  - definitions, theorems, proofs
- Reading a single page in under an hour is too fast
- ponder and internalize each definition
- on theorems, find examples to show why each hypothesis is necessary

## [Chapter 1. Vector Spaces](./CHAPTER_1.md)

Linear algebra is the study of `linear maps` on `finite-dimensional vector spaces`

Dude this is insane:

- subspaces are to vector spaces
  - as subsets are to sets
- sums of subspaces, analogous to
  - unions of subsets
- direct sums of subspaces, analogous to
  - unions of disjoint sets
